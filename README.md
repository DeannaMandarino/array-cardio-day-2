# Array Cardio Day 2

A continuation of exercises to practice using various array methods in JavaScript, including `some()`, `every()`, `find()`, and `findIndex()`. This project is part of the JavaScript30 challenge, further developing problem-solving skills with JavaScript arrays.

## Description

In this project, we work with two arrays:
- An array of people, each with a name and birth year.
- An array of comments, each with text and a unique ID.

The challenge includes performing operations on these arrays using various JavaScript array methods such as:
- `some()` to check if at least one person is 19 or older.
- `every()` to verify if everyone is 19 or older.
- `find()` to locate a comment by its ID.
- `findIndex()` to find the index of a specific comment and remove it from the array.

The project enhances understanding of array methods and functional programming in JavaScript.

## Features

- **Checking Adults**: Uses `some()` to check if at least one person is 19 or older.
- **Verifying All Adults**: Uses `every()` to confirm if all people in the array are 19 or older.
- **Finding a Comment**: Uses `find()` to retrieve a comment by its unique ID.
- **Deleting a Comment**: Uses `findIndex()` to find a comment by ID and remove it from the array, demonstrating immutability.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. You can also open `script.js` in the browser console to test the array operations and see the results.
